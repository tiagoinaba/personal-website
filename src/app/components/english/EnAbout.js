      I’m a Front-end developer from Brazil. Although only recently have I
      decided to work as a developer, my journey in coding started pretty early.
      <br />
      <br />
      I started off with Java when I was around 13, because I wanted to make my
      own Minecraft plugins.
      <br />
      <br />
      Building on that, towards the end of 2022 - when I decided to work in this
      area - I learned a little bit of Spring but quickly saw it wasn’t for me.
      So I switched to front-end and that’s where I really found myself.
      <br />
      <br />
      Of course I went back and picked Spring back up, which I used on a Flutter
      app I made for employee management that connects to a SolrCloud server.
      The source code for it can be seen{" "}

      <br />
      I feel particularly very passionate about good looking interfaces and CSS
      animations.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am also a guitarist who unluckily had to fill in as a bassist.
